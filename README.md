# Chess App
This repo contains a work in progress chess web application. I am using this project to better learn web technologies and gain familiarity with AWS.

<h2>Project Goals</h2>

To create a full stack end to end web application using modern methods (agile, test-driven development, microservices).

To learn full stack web development and showcase my ability to learn new technologies and create tested reliable software. 

To experiment with elastic cloud services and various distributed application designs.

<h2>Design</h2>

The frontend is built with React.

The backend is built with Django and MySQL / MariaDB and uses a RESTful API.

The website is being built and tested on an AWS EC2 instance using S3 for storage.  

<h2>Progress</h2>

With progress being made across the stack I am beginning to develop a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker.

The frontend is minamally functional with further React components to come.

Jest is used for testing for the frontend. 

I have created the Django data models and am starting to write the RestAPI.
