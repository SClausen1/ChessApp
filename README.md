# Chess App
This repo contains a work in progress chess web application. I am using this project to learn full stack web development and showcase my ability to create software. 

The frontend is built with React and running on an Apache Server in an AWS EC2 instance. This is minamally functional until i finish the testing infastructure using Jest. 

I plan to use Jenkins for the testing automation pipline but this is not set up yet.

The backend is built with Django and MySQL / MariaDB. I have created the data models and am starting to write the RestAPI.
